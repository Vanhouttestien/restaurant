### Fixed bugs 
- The right and wrong images where to big when the answer had more lines because they are implemented by using them as background. This was especially problematic on smaller devices. The symbols came above the text. Fixed by adapting the background size to 28px.   
- Background image didn't cover the whole page. this was solved by adding a min-height of 100vh and hide the overflow. 

### Unfixed bugs
- by fixing the measurements of the right and wrong symbol they sometimes are a bit to high up.
