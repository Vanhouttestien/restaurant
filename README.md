With the current climate change the face of the Artic is rapidly changing. The Arctic is being hit hard and the impacts of climate change on the local flora and fauna is huge. Small children don't know a lot about the artic. The Artic quiz was developed for children to improve their knowledge about the artic and stimulate their curiosity in a fun and interactive way. In this way we hope to contribute to the overall conscience of the people, by making the arctic more visible and improve knowledge.

## User Experience (UX)
### User stories
#### Visitor goals
- The main goal is to provide the users with more information about the Arctic
- The user should have good insight in the content when viewing the startpage
- The user should have an intutive and easy accesible buttons to start the quiz
- The user should receive direct feedback on the answer
- The user should have the possiblity to restart the quiz and try to improve

### Design 
1. wireframe

2. Database
For the design there was chosen for a colourful background with a more sober layout to balans it. This keeps it playful but also accesible at the same time.  


3. Images

To support the topic of the quiz a image of the artic and the aurora borealis was chosen as background. 

Some questions are accompagnied by images as part of the question or for decorative purpose. 


4. Colour Scheme

Beacuse of the colourful background image the other parts of the design where kept simple. The colours black and white where chosen for this. They also provide optimal accesibilty. 


5. Typography

The font chosen is Arial and Helvetica as back-up. These fonts are easy to read and provide good accesibility. They are also simple in design and provide a more sober contrast to the colorful background image.

## manual code testing
### responsiveness

### Fixed bugs 
- The right and wrong images where to big when the answer had more lines because they are implemented by using them as background. This was especially problematic on smaller devices. The symbols came above the text. Fixed by adapting the background size to 28px.   
- Background image didn't cover the whole page. this was solved by adding a min-height of 100vh and hide the overflow. 

### Unfixed bugs
- by fixing the measurements of the right and wrong symbol they sometimes are a bit to high up.
